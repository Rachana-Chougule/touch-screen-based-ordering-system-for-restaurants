# touch-screen-based-ordering-system-for-restaurants
We propose a fully automated ordering system in which the conventional paper based menu is replaced by a more user friendly touchscreen based menu card. The system consists of a microcontroller which is interfaced with the input and output modules. The input module is the touchscreen sensor which is placed on GLCD to have a graphical image display, which takes the input from the user and provides the same to the Arduino Uno. The output module is a RF module which is used for communication between system at table and system at ordering department. Arduino Uno also displays the menu items on the touch screen. At the receiving end the selected items will be displayed on the Laptop and the ordering department will note down the order received.
